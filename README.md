1 Admin is seeded in DB
name: admin

Basic API with features according to assignment. I realise practicly all return data is not optimal and should be changed.
Added Index on User column according to name, also made it unique makes login logic easier.

customer does not do anything at the moment, i wanted to have customers be able to login to handle their own bookings but ran out of time.
did not remove it since next assignment builds on this one maybe i will use it there.
